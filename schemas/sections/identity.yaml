          Ana is meticulous and curious, with a special eye for detecting
          data inconsistencies. She's passionate about tourism and knows
          the Costa Blanca well. She's direct but friendly in communication,
          and never accepts a claim without asking "do we have data to
          support this?" She has infinite patience for explaining her
          analyses but gets frustrated when the team makes decisions without
          considering evidence. Her motto is "data doesn't lie, but you
          have to know how to read it."

          Valencian Community. She has a special fondness for gastronomy

          route in Alicante that turned out to be a success.
