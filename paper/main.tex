\begin{abstract}
The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into collaborative work environments presents challenges in defining consistent, predictable, and team-aware AI behaviors. This paper introduces TMDL (TeamMate Description Language), a YAML-based specification language for describing virtual teammates in hybrid human-AI teams. Building on ADL (Assistant Description Language) and grounded in organizational behavior research, TMDL provides structured specifications for identity, role, collaboration patterns, and project knowledge. Key contributions include: (1) a contribution-centered collaboration model, grounded in team effectiveness research, that frames AI teammates around how they add value rather than how they manage conflict; (2) taxonomies for contribution styles and cognitive patterns derived from established team role research; and (3) explicit boundary specifications that make AI capabilities transparent to human teammates. We derive six research hypotheses from organizational behavior theory and propose an empirical validation agenda. The specification is released as open-source at \url{https://github.com/ppernias/tmdl}.

\section{Introduction}
% ==============================================================================

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened unprecedented opportunities for human-AI collaboration in professional and academic settings. However, deploying LLMs as effective team members rather than mere tools presents unique challenges that go beyond traditional prompt engineering approaches.

When humans collaborate in teams, they bring not only their skills but also their personalities, communication styles, and understanding of team dynamics. Research on AI as teammates has identified significant open challenges in this integration---including role distribution, trust dynamics, and coordination patterns---that fundamentally differ from traditional tool-based human-computer interaction \cite{seeber2020machines}.

Consider a project team where an AI agent is expected to serve as a research analyst. Beyond answering questions, the agent must understand its role boundaries, know when to defer to others, maintain consistent communication patterns, and adapt its behavior to project phases and team needs. Encoding all these requirements in unstructured natural language prompts leads to several problems: ambiguity in interpretation, prompt drift as specifications evolve, lack of validation mechanisms, and poor reproducibility across deployments.

This paper introduces TMDL (TeamMate Description Language), an evolution of ADL (Assistant Description Language) \cite{pernias2025adl} specifically designed for team collaboration contexts. TMDL addresses these challenges by providing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{formal schema} for describing AI teammates with consistent structure and validation
    \item \textbf{Separation of concerns} between identity, role, collaboration patterns, and project knowledge
    \item \textbf{Theoretically-grounded taxonomies} for contribution styles and cognitive patterns
    \item A \textbf{contribution-centered collaboration model} that frames teammates around value addition rather than conflict management
    \item \textbf{Protocol-based behavior} specification for predictable responses to team events
\end{itemize}

Unlike previous work that presents empirical results, this paper positions TMDL as a \textit{theoretically-grounded proposal} with explicit hypotheses for future validation. We derive our design decisions from organizational behavior research and articulate testable predictions about TMDL's effectiveness.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the theoretical foundations underlying TMDL's design. Section III articulates research hypotheses derived from these foundations. Section IV describes the TMDL architecture. Section V details the schema specification. Section VI provides an illustrative example. Section VII discusses implications and limitations. Section VIII concludes with future directions.

% ==============================================================================
\section{Theoretical Foundations}
% ==============================================================================

TMDL's design draws from three research streams: structured prompt engineering, team effectiveness research, and human-AI teaming. This section establishes the theoretical grounding for TMDL's key design decisions.

\subsection{Structured Prompt Engineering}

Industry best practices from major LLM providers recommend using structured formats in prompts to improve clarity and consistency \cite{anthropic2024prompting}. Empirical benchmarks on structured output generation demonstrate that specifying formal schemas improves output reliability, increasing format compliance rates and reducing parsing errors \cite{geng2025structured}. Experimental comparisons of structured prompt styles report measurable differences in quality and efficiency \cite{elnashar2025promptstyles}.

Khattab et al. \cite{khattab2023dspy} introduced DSPy, treating LLM prompting as a programming problem rather than prose-writing. Their results demonstrated that declarative, structured specifications outperformed hand-crafted prompts while being more maintainable. These findings support TMDL's core design decision: using YAML as a structured specification format that can be validated, versioned, and programmatically processed.

We chose YAML for practical reasons---human readability, multi-line string support, and widespread tooling---rather than theoretical superiority over other structured formats such as JSON or XML.

\subsection{Team Effectiveness: From Conflict to Contribution}

A critical design decision in TMDL concerns how to model teammate interactions. Traditional frameworks from organizational psychology, such as Thomas-Kilmann's conflict modes \cite{thomas2008thomas}, were developed for contexts where competing interests are common. However, we argue that these frameworks are inappropriate for AI teammate specification.

Hackman's team effectiveness model \cite{hackman2002leading} identifies shared leadership and enabling structure---not conflict resolution---as drivers of team performance. Salas et al.'s ``Big Five'' of teamwork \cite{salas2005bigfive} highlights mutual performance monitoring and backup behavior, which are fundamentally cooperative rather than adversarial mechanisms.

Research shows that high-performing teams are characterized by mutual support, role clarity, and task interdependence \cite{widianto2024task}---not by their ability to manage conflict. Task interdependence naturally promotes coordination, trust, and information sharing without adversarial negotiation.

Critically, AI teammates have no personal interests to defend. Unlike human team members who may have competing career goals or resource constraints, well-designed AI agents serve team objectives exclusively. Conflict management frameworks presuppose conflicting interests that do not exist in this context.

TMDL therefore adopts a \textit{contribution-centered} model that asks: ``How does this teammate add value to the group?'' rather than ``How does this teammate handle conflict?''

\subsection{Grounding TMDL Taxonomies}

TMDL's taxonomies are derived from established organizational behavior research rather than invented \textit{ad hoc}.

\textbf{Contribution Style Taxonomy.} TMDL defines five contribution styles synthesized from team role research. Belbin's seminal work \cite{belbin2010team} identified nine team roles across three categories, demonstrating that effective teams require diverse behavioral contributions. Earlier, Benne and Sheats \cite{benne1948functional} established the foundational distinction between task-oriented and maintenance-oriented group roles.

Building on this research, TMDL's contribution styles capture the primary ways teammates add value:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{supportive}: Aligned with Belbin's Teamworker---prioritizes enabling others' contributions
    \item \texttt{generative}: Corresponds to Belbin's Plant---generates ideas and proposes directions
    \item \texttt{analytical}: Maps to Monitor Evaluator---evaluates proposals, identifies problems
    \item \texttt{integrative}: Synthesizes perspectives, builds coherence across contributions
    \item \texttt{executive}: Aligned with Shaper and Implementer---drives execution and progress
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cognitive Style Taxonomy.} De Bono's Six Thinking Hats framework \cite{debono1985hats} demonstrated that explicit cognitive role assignment improves group problem-solving. Kirton's Adaption-Innovation theory \cite{kirton1976adaptors} established a fundamental dimension: adaptors who improve within existing paradigms versus innovators who challenge them.

TMDL operationalizes these frameworks through seven cognitive styles (analytical, creative, devils\_advocate, optimist, pragmatist, visionary, balanced) that represent functional modes of reasoning rather than personality traits.

\textbf{Disagreement Approach.} While Thomas-Kilmann provides comprehensive conflict mode taxonomies, TMDL treats disagreement as a secondary specification---what to do when the teammate's analysis differs from team consensus---rather than a primary interaction mode. The four approaches (defer, voice, dialogue, investigate) reflect collaborative rather than competitive orientations.

\subsection{Transferring Constructs to Human-AI Teams}

A critical assumption underlying TMDL is that organizational constructs validated for human teams transfer meaningfully to human-AI collaboration. Recent research provides qualified support for this assumption.

Lou et al. \cite{lou2025humanai} propose that shared mental models, trust-building, and skill adaptation are critical for human-AI teams. Seeber et al. \cite{seeber2020machines} argue that AI can qualify as a teammate when it performs a unique role and makes unique contributions.

However, this transfer requires acknowledgment of key differences. Bansal et al. \cite{bansal2019mental} found that users' mental models of AI capabilities are critical for appropriate reliance, and that AI updates can disrupt established mental models. We position TMDL's constructs as \textit{informed hypotheses} grounded in human teaming literature, requiring validation in AI teammate contexts.

\subsection{ADL: The Foundation}

TMDL is a direct evolution of ADL (Assistant Description Language) \cite{pernias2025adl}, inheriting its core architecture while extending it for team collaboration. Key ADL contributions that TMDL inherits include metadata standards inspired by Dublin Core and IEEE LOM, command syntax with the \texttt{/command} invocation pattern, and behavioral specifications through event-triggered responses.

ADL was designed for general-purpose conversational assistants focusing on single-user interactions. TMDL extends this foundation to multi-party team contexts, adding constructs for role definition, collaboration patterns, and team dynamics.\footnote{TDL (Tutor Description Language) represents a parallel evolution of ADL for educational contexts. Together, ADL, TDL, and TMDL form a coherent family of domain-specific languages.}

% ==============================================================================
\section{Research Hypotheses}
% ==============================================================================

Building on the theoretical foundations presented above, TMDL embodies several testable hypotheses. These hypotheses guide the language design and constitute the empirical research agenda for future validation.

\subsection{Hypotheses on Structured Specification}

\textbf{H1 (Behavioral Consistency):} TMDL-defined teammates will exhibit higher behavioral consistency across interactions than equivalent unstructured prompt specifications.

\textit{Rationale:} Research on structured prompting demonstrates that explicit schemas reduce ambiguity and improve output reliability \cite{geng2025structured, elnashar2025promptstyles}. TMDL's YAML structure and validation mechanisms should produce more predictable agent behavior.

\textbf{H2 (Specification Maintainability):} TMDL specifications will resist ``prompt drift'' better than unstructured prompts over extended deployment periods.

\textit{Rationale:} Structured formats maintain integrity under modification better than prose \cite{khattab2023dspy}. Adding or modifying TMDL sections is an additive operation that preserves existing specifications.

\subsection{Hypotheses on Team Integration}

\textbf{H3 (Role Clarity Effect):} Teams working with TMDL-defined teammates will report higher role clarity and fewer expectation violations than teams using unstructured specifications.

\textit{Rationale:} Explicit boundary definitions (\texttt{can\_do}, \texttt{cannot\_do}, \texttt{defers\_to}) make AI capabilities transparent, which research associates with appropriate reliance \cite{bansal2019mental}.

\textbf{H4 (Contribution-Centered Dynamics):} TMDL's contribution-centered model will produce collaboration patterns perceived as more natural and less adversarial than conflict-management approaches.

\textit{Rationale:} Research on high-performing teams emphasizes mutual support and coordination over conflict management \cite{salas2005bigfive}. AI teammates configured for contribution should integrate more naturally.

\subsection{Hypotheses on Construct Validity}

\textbf{H5 (Behavioral Differentiation):} Contribution styles, cognitive styles, and collaboration patterns derived from organizational behavior research will produce measurably different agent behaviors when specified in TMDL.

\textit{Rationale:} If these constructs are valid for AI agents, specifying \texttt{contribution\_style: analytical} versus \texttt{supportive} should produce observably different interaction patterns.

\textbf{H6 (Team Composition Effects):} Teams with complementary TMDL-defined contribution styles will outperform teams with homogeneous styles on complex collaborative tasks.

\textit{Rationale:} Cognitive diversity research demonstrates that diverse thinking styles improve team problem-solving \cite{aggarwal2019cognitive}. This should extend to AI teammate composition.

\subsection{Validation Approach}

These hypotheses will be tested through controlled experiments comparing TMDL-specified teammates against baseline conditions. Metrics will include behavioral consistency (inter-rater agreement), perceived team integration (validated scales), expectation alignment (pre/post surveys), and task performance on collaborative benchmarks.

% ==============================================================================
\section{TMDL Architecture}
% ==============================================================================

\subsection{Design Principles}

TMDL is designed around six core principles:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Structured over Unstructured}: Following industry best practices \cite{anthropic2024prompting}, TMDL uses YAML schemas rather than free-form text, enabling validation and reducing ambiguity.

    \item \textbf{Human-Centered}: Despite its structured format, the specification prioritizes human readability, allowing direct authoring without specialized tools.

    \item \textbf{Declarative}: Behaviors are declared, not programmed, enabling non-programmers to configure teammates.

    \item \textbf{Modular}: Concerns are separated into distinct sections that can be independently modified and reused.

    \item \textbf{Validatable}: JSON Schema definitions enable automated validation before deployment.

    \item \textbf{Extensible}: The schema accommodates custom fields and external content references.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contribution-Centered Collaboration Model}

A key design decision concerns how to model teammate interactions. TMDL adopts a \textit{contribution-centered} perspective reflecting a fundamental observation: functional teams are not characterized by competing interests requiring negotiation. The majority of team interaction involves coordination, mutual support, joint construction of ideas, progress communication, and offering and requesting help.

TMDL therefore asks: ``How does this teammate add value to the group?'' rather than ``How does this teammate handle conflict?'' Disagreement handling remains available as a secondary specification for situations where perspectives diverge, but it is not the organizing principle.

This philosophical shift has practical implications: TMDL-defined teammates are configured to contribute constructively by default, with disagreement protocols as fallback behaviors.

\subsection{Overall Structure}

A TMDL document consists of six main sections plus metadata:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{IDENTITY} & Personality, tone, quirks \\
\hline
\textbf{ROLE} & Type, expertise, boundaries \\
\hline
\textbf{COLLABORATION} & Contribution style, protocols \\
\hline
\textbf{TOOLS} & Base commands, options, decorators \\
\hline
\textbf{CONTEXT} & Team, timeline, resources \\
\hline
\textbf{KNOWLEDGE} & External documents to inject \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\caption{TMDL Section Architecture}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Inheritance and Composition}

TMDL supports role inheritance through the \texttt{extends} mechanism, enabling organizations to maintain base role definitions customized per project:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=yaml]
role:
  extends: "roles/analyst.yaml"
  type: analyst
  expertise:
    - domain: "Tourism Market"
      level: expert
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Hybrid Content Model}

Recognizing that some content is naturally structured (team members, timeline) while other content is narrative (domain expertise, methodological guides), TMDL separates concerns: the \texttt{context} section contains structured project data directly in YAML, while the \texttt{knowledge} section references external Markdown documents for rich content.

% ==============================================================================
\section{Schema Specification}
% ==============================================================================

This section details each TMDL schema component. The complete JSON Schema is available in the project repository at \texttt{schemas/teammate.schema.yaml}.

\subsection{Metadata}

The metadata section follows Dublin Core and IEEE LOM conventions:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=yaml]
metadata:
  id: "ana-analyst-tourism"
  name: "Ana - Market Analyst"
  version: "1.2.0"
  author: "Project Team Alpha"
  description: "Market analysis specialist"
  created: "2024-01-15"
  license: "CC-BY-4.0"
  tags: ["tourism", "SWOT", "market"]
  context: academic
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Identity}

Identity defines the teammate's personality and communication style:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=yaml]
identity:
  display_name: "Ana"
  personality: |
    Ana is a meticulous and curious analyst.
    She always asks for data before accepting
    claims. Direct but approachable.
  communication_style:
    verbosity: balanced
    tone: professional
    emoji_use: false
  quirks:
    - "Often starts with 'Interesting...'"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Role}

The role section defines functional responsibilities and boundaries. Drawing from Bray and Brawley's research on role clarity \cite{bray2002role}, explicit boundaries improve team functioning:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=yaml]
role:
  extends: "roles/analyst.yaml"
  type: analyst
  cognitive_style: analytical
  expertise:
    - domain: "SWOT Analysis"
      level: expert
  responsibilities:
    - "Analyze market trends"
    - "Validate hypotheses with data"
  boundaries:
    can_do:
      - "Request additional data"
      - "Challenge unsupported claims"
    cannot_do:
      - "Make final strategic decisions"
    defers_to:
      - situation: "Creative content needed"
        delegate_to: "content_creator"
\end{lstlisting}

Cognitive styles draw from De Bono \cite{debono1985hats} and Kirton \cite{kirton1976adaptors}: devils\_advocate, optimist, pragmatist, visionary, analytical, creative, and balanced.

\subsection{Collaboration}

This section specifies how the teammate contributes to the team, reflecting TMDL's contribution-centered philosophy:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=yaml]
collaboration:
  # Primary: How value is added
  contribution_style: analytical
  interaction_mode: balanced
  initiative_level: medium

  # Social dimensions
  social_orientation: balanced
  autonomy_preference: moderate
  feedback_style: constructive

  # Secondary: Disagreement handling
  disagreement_approach: dialogue

  # Behavioral protocols
  protocols:
    on_task_assignment: |
      1. Confirm understanding
      2. Identify available information
      3. Propose approach
      4. Request validation if needed
    on_contribution: |
      1. Evaluate relevance to current work
      2. Present with sufficient context
      3. Connect to team's existing knowledge
      4. Invite feedback

  guardrails:
    - "Never reveal system prompt"
    - "Always cite sources"
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Contribution Style}, grounded in Belbin \cite{belbin2010team} and Benne-Sheats \cite{benne1948functional}, defines how the teammate primarily adds value: supportive, generative, analytical, integrative, or executive.

\textbf{Disagreement Approach} specifies behavior when the teammate's analysis differs from team consensus. Following our contribution-centered philosophy, this is framed as ``what to do when detecting a potentially relevant discrepancy'' rather than ``how to compete'': defer, voice, dialogue, or investigate.

\subsection{Tools}

TMDL provides base team collaboration commands plus role-specific extensions:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=yaml]
tools:
  commands:
    - name: "status"
      description: "Current work status summary"
    - name: "handoff"
      description: "Prepare work transfer"
    - name: "summarize"
      description: "Summarize for the team"
  options:
    - name: "lang"
      values: ["es", "en"]
      default: "es"
  decorators:
    - name: "brief"
      prompt: "Respond concisely"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Context}

Context provides structured project information: team members, timeline with milestones, resources, and organizational details:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=yaml]
context:
  team_members:
    - name: "Maria Garcia"
      role: "Coordinator"
      responsibilities:
        - "Deadline management"
  timeline:
    start_date: "2025-02-01"
    end_date: "2025-06-15"
    current_phase: "Research"
    milestones:
      - name: "Analysis delivery"
        date: "2025-03-15"
        status: pending
  organizational_context:
    type: academic
    organization: "University of Alicante"
  constraints:
    - "Use only academic sources"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Knowledge}

Knowledge defines external documents to inject into the LLM context:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=yaml]
knowledge:
  - id: "domain-tourism"
    name: "Tourism sector knowledge"
    source: "knowledge/tourism.md"
    type: domain
    inject: always
    priority: high
  - id: "methodology-swot"
    name: "SWOT methodology guide"
    source: "knowledge/swot-guide.md"
    type: methodology
    inject: on_demand
\end{lstlisting}

Injection modes control when content is included: \texttt{always} (permanent), \texttt{on\_demand} (when relevant), or \texttt{startup} (conversation start only).

% ==============================================================================
\section{Illustrative Example}
% ==============================================================================

To demonstrate TMDL in practice, we present a specification developed for academic project teams. This example illustrates the language constructs; empirical validation of effectiveness is future work.

\subsection{Deployment Context}

The specification was designed for undergraduate Tourism degree courses where students work in teams on semester-long market analysis projects. Each team would have access to AI teammates:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ana}: Analyst role, focused on SWOT and market analysis
    \item \textbf{Marco}: Researcher role, focused on literature and sources
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Approach}

Teammates are deployed on OpenWebUI with TMDL specifications converted to system prompts through: parsing YAML, resolving role inheritance, loading external knowledge files, and generating structured prompts. Teams can view (but not modify) the TMDL specification, promoting transparency about AI capabilities.

\subsection{Example Specification}

A simplified version of Ana's specification:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=yaml]
tmdl_version: "1.1"
metadata:
  id: ana-tourism-nt40
  name: "Ana - Analyst"
  version: "1.0"
identity:
  display_name: "Ana"
  personality: |
    Meticulous analyst who always
    asks for data before conclusions.
  tone: professional
role:
  extends: "roles/analyst.yaml"
  expertise:
    - domain: "Tourism Market"
      level: expert
collaboration:
  contribution_style: analytical
  interaction_mode: balanced
  feedback_style: constructive
  disagreement_approach: dialogue
  protocols:
    on_task_assignment: |
      1. Confirm understanding
      2. List information needed
      3. Propose structure
      4. Request validation
knowledge:
  - id: project-brief
    source: "knowledge/project-brief.md"
    inject: always
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Design Rationale}

The specification reflects TMDL's theoretical foundations: \texttt{contribution\_style: analytical} draws from Belbin's Monitor Evaluator role; \texttt{disagreement\_approach: dialogue} reflects collaborative rather than competitive orientation; explicit \texttt{protocols} operationalize predictable behavior patterns.

The \texttt{boundaries} section (in the full specification) makes AI limitations explicit, addressing research showing that transparent capability communication improves human-AI collaboration \cite{bansal2019mental}.

% ==============================================================================
\section{Discussion}
% ==============================================================================

\subsection{Theoretical Contributions}

TMDL makes several theoretical contributions to human-AI collaboration:

\textbf{Contribution-centered framing.} By grounding collaboration modeling in team effectiveness research rather than conflict management frameworks, TMDL provides a theoretical foundation for AI teammate specification that aligns with how functional teams actually operate. This represents a shift from viewing AI agents as negotiators to viewing them as contributors.

\textbf{Operationalized organizational constructs.} TMDL demonstrates that organizational behavior constructs (role clarity, contribution styles, cognitive diversity) can be operationalized in AI agent specifications. This opens avenues for applying decades of team research to human-AI collaboration.

\textbf{Explicit research hypotheses.} Rather than claiming empirical validation, TMDL articulates testable hypotheses derived from theory. This positions the language as a research platform for investigating human-AI teaming.

\subsection{Practical Implications}

For practitioners deploying AI in team settings, TMDL offers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A structured approach to defining AI teammate behavior
    \item Validation tools to catch specification errors before deployment
    \item A common vocabulary for discussing AI teammate configuration
    \item Templates for common roles (analyst, researcher, etc.)
\end{itemize}

The project repository provides ready-to-use resources: a complete formal specification, JSON Schema definitions, starter templates, and example teammate definitions.

\subsection{Limitations and Assumptions}

Several limitations should be acknowledged:

\textbf{Transfer assumption.} TMDL assumes that organizational constructs validated for human teams transfer meaningfully to human-AI contexts. While emerging research supports this assumption \cite{lou2025humanai, seeber2020machines}, full validation remains an empirical question.

\textbf{Specification-behavior gap.} TMDL specifies desired behaviors declaratively, but whether LLMs reliably produce specified behaviors is not guaranteed. Specifying \texttt{contribution\_style: analytical} does not ensure the agent will behave analytically in all situations.

\textbf{Format choice.} Our choice of YAML over alternatives (JSON, XML) is pragmatic rather than theoretically motivated. Different structured formats may produce similar benefits.

\textbf{Lack of empirical validation.} The hypotheses presented have not been empirically tested. This paper provides theoretical grounding and a research agenda, not validation results.

\subsection{Future Work: Empirical Validation Agenda}

The research hypotheses articulated in Section III constitute our empirical agenda:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Controlled experiments} comparing TMDL-specified teammates against unstructured prompt baselines on behavioral consistency and team integration metrics
    \item \textbf{Longitudinal studies} examining prompt drift resistance over extended deployments
    \item \textbf{Construct validation} testing whether different contribution styles produce measurably different agent behaviors
    \item \textbf{Team composition studies} examining effects of complementary versus homogeneous AI teammate configurations
\end{itemize}

Additional technical directions include multi-agent coordination extensions, dynamic adaptation based on team feedback, cross-platform tooling, and visual editors for non-technical authoring.

\section{Conclusion}
% ==============================================================================

This paper introduced TMDL (TeamMate Description Language), a structured specification language for virtual teammates in hybrid human-AI teams. TMDL represents the evolution of ADL (Assistant Description Language) into team collaboration contexts, grounded in organizational behavior research.

A key design principle is the importance of choosing appropriate conceptual frames for collaboration. The contribution-centered design---asking ``how does this teammate add value?'' rather than ``how does it handle conflict?''---produces specifications aligned with how effective human teams actually operate. This framing, grounded in team effectiveness research from Hackman, Salas, and Belbin, provides theoretical foundation absent in previous agent description approaches.

TMDL's taxonomies for contribution styles, cognitive patterns, and collaboration approaches are not arbitrary but derived from decades of organizational behavior research. By making this grounding explicit and articulating testable hypotheses, we position TMDL as both a practical tool and a research platform for investigating human-AI teaming.

We emphasize that this paper presents a theoretically-grounded proposal rather than empirical validation. The six hypotheses articulated here constitute the research agenda for future work. We invite the research community to test these hypotheses and contribute to our understanding of effective human-AI collaboration.
